To allow components to remember things in react - use state

- make a component stateful by setting this.state in the class
component's constructor!
    
    - Constructors
    - Special functions that create and initialize an object instance of a class.
    - Called when an object is created using "new" keyword.
    - In contect of React - Used to initialize state in a react class components

    *NOTE
        - Always call 'super' when defining the constructor of a subcalss.
        - ALL React component classes having a constrcutor should start with a super(props)
         call!

- this.state is considered private to the react component in which it's 
defined.

- setState()
    - Schedules an update to a component's state object.
    - When state changes, component responds by re-rendering.
    - When setState is called inside a component, React automatically udates child components inside f
    it too.

Key differences between state and props?
    - props (short for properties) and state are both vanilla JS objects.
        - Both hold infomration that influences the output of the render() method
    * props get passed to a component in same manner as parameters are passed to functions
    * state: Managed WITHIN the component (Similar to variables declared within a function)

Lifting State up
    - To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components
    communicate w/ each other, declare the shared state in their parent component.

    - Parent component will pass the stat back to the child component via props.
        -This keeps child components properly synced w/ each other and w/ the parent component.
