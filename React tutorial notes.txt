1. "state"
- Allows components to remember things.

- Components become stateful by setting this.state in their constructors and is considered to be private to the component in whcih it's defined.

NOTE:
JavaScript classes in React CAN have construtors!

Constructors
- Used to initialize 'state' of the component.

> When using a constructor in a JS class we must ALWAYS call super() when defining the constructor of a subcalss.

>
ALL React component classes that have a constructor should begin w/ the call to super(props)
